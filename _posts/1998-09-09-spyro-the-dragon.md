excerpt: "In this PlayStation classic platformer, play as a small purple dragon named Spyro as you save the Dragon World from Gnasty Gnorc and his minions. As a dragon, you can breathe fire, charge with your horns, and glide with your small wings. You must rescue the dragon elders encased in crystal, rescue the stolen baby dragon eggs, and collect the dragons' stolen gems. This series is a personal favorite of mine."
