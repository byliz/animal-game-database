<h3>What is <em>Kemono</em> and <em>Kemonomimi</em>?</h3>

<p class="excerpt">

<em>Kemono</em> is the Japanese word for "animal" or "beast" and refers to anthropomorphic animal characters - animal characters with human characteristics such as talking and walking on two legs. <em>Kemonomimi</em> means "animal ears" and refers to zoomorphic human characters - human characters with animal traits such as animal ears and tails. <em>Kemono</em> differ from western anthropomorphic characters in that they usually follow the "cute" and "cool" trends of anime or manga art styles including large eyes and short snouts, giving them a stylized form that is closer to human than animal. Because anthropomorphism is a spectrum, animal characters in games featured on this website can range from almost completely human (people with cat ears) to almost completely non-human (cats who communicate or think using human language).

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p class="excerpt">

This website was originally made to record all video games in which animals are important to the plot or gameplay, but I realized this topic was way too broad. This website will now record only Japanese or Japanese-inspired games, anime, and manga featuring <em>kemono</em> and <em>kemonomimi</em> characters.

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p class="excerpt">

Compared to western art styles, I prefer the Japanese anime art style. I feel like some people have acquired an aversion to animal characters because of the western furry community, so I wanted to expose people to the Japanese varient which has crossover with the more openly accepted anime and manga community. I also wanted to make it more easy to find and share games in this particular niche. A lot of times really interesting things go unnoticed because of the language barrier or because they don't rank well on popular search engines.</p>
  
<h3>How it Works</h3>

<p class="excerpt">I made this website by hand from scratch and use <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> to host it. You can check out the source code <a href="http://github.com/cozymaus/kemono-database" target="_blank">here</a>. This website is a static website generated using the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> static site generator.</p>
