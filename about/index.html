<h3>What is <em>Kemono</em> and <em>Kemonomimi</em>?</h3>

<p class="excerpt">

<em>Kemono</em> is the Japanese word for "animal" or "beast" and refers to anthropomorphic animal characters - animal characters with human characteristics such as talking and walking on two legs. <em>Kemonomimi</em> means "animal ears" and refers to zoomorphic human characters - human characters with animal traits such as animal ears and tails.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p class="excerpt">

This website was originally made to record all video games in which animals are important to the plot or gameplay, but I realized this topic was way too broad. This website will now record only Japanese or Japanese-inspired games, anime, and manga featuring <em>kemono</em> and <em>kemonomimi</em> characters.

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p class="excerpt">

Compared to western art styles, I prefer the way the Japanese design their animal characters. I feel like the furry community gives animal characters a bad wrap, but I wanted to expose people to the more aesthetically pleasing <em>kemono</em> characters in Japanese entertainment. I also wanted to make it more easy to find and share games, anime, and manga in this particular niche. A lot of times really interesting media goes unnoticed because of the language barrier or because they don't rank well on popular search engines.
