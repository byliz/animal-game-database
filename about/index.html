<h2>üóÑÔ∏è About this Database</h2>

<p>Site last updated {{ site.time | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}.</p> 
  
<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>

This website was originally made to record all video games in which animals are important to the plot or gameplay, but I realized this topic was way too broad. This website will now record only games featuring dragons.
  
</p>


<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>

  Dragons are cool. They exist in the stories of many cultures all around the world. There's a wide variety of them, and they're everywhere, yet I think there aren't enough dragons in video games. I want this website to record all of these tiles, no matter how obscure they may be, so that a wider audience can find them and enjoy them.

<h3>How it Works</h3>

<p class="excerpt">I made this website by hand from scratch and use <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> to host it. You can check out the source code <a href="http://github.com/cozymaus/kemono-database" target="_blank">here</a>. This website is a static website generated using the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> static site generator. Entries must be manually added as a markup file in the _posts folder.</p>
  
<h3>Contributions</h3>

<p>
The Contribute button on the navigation menu goes to an external Google Form where you can submit any suggestions for games that you think should be listed.
