		2. Before making suggestions please check if it's already been added by using the search bar in the navigation panel or entering a URL in your browser's address bar in the following format: <em>https://agdb.smugcroc.com/#(gametitle)</em>. Replace <em>(gametitle)</em> with the title of the game in all lower case and with no spaces.<br>
